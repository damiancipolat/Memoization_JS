# Memoization
Is an optimization **technique** used primarily to **speed up computer** programs by storing the results of expensive function calls and returning the cached result when the same inputs occur again.

### Memoizing
Memoizing in simple terms means memorizing or storing in memory. A memoized function is usually faster because if the function is called subsequently with the previous value(s), then instead of executing the function, we would be fetching the result from the cache.

### Pure funtions
A function is a process which takes some input, called arguments, and produces some output called a return value.

### Is same as caching?
Yes, Memoization is actually a specific type of caching. While caching can refer in general to any storing technique (like HTTP caching) for future use, memoizing specifically involves caching the return values of a function.

### When to memoize your functions?
- Only pure functions.
- Api calls.
- Heavy computational functions.
